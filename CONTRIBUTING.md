==============================

Thank you for your interest in OHMS. We look forward for your support. You can contribute in any of the following ways
* Download and start exploring it. "Star" the repository if you liked the project
* Test and Report bugs if you find any
* Look at the pending issues https://github.com/vmware/OHMS/issues and contribute with code and documentation


## Reporting Issues
===================
Please use github issues https://github.com/vmware/OHMS/issues to raise new feature requests or bugs.


### How to Contribute
=====================
NOTE: If you do decide to implement code changes and contribute them, please make sure you agree with, that your contribution can be made available under the Apache version 2 license.  If you update an existing file, make sure that you do not add another copy of the Apache license header and do not change the existing copyright lines from other copyright holders as well. You may add additional copyright lines.

OHMS uses github’s pull-request process, documented here:
   https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

The pull-request approach allows for individual repositories to adjust things to fit the nature of the project. The general approach one can follow is:

1. Fork the main repository.
2. Create a branch with meaningful name (say NewFeature) on the forked repository.
2. Add the required code changes for the feature requested to the newly created branch, NewFeature.
3. Create a pull request to merge the changes done in NewFeature to the appropriate branch of the main repository.

Here’s the policies adopted by OHMS to help track reporting and completion of code requests:
* Do not submit pull requests against the master branch. Use the development branch for most pull-requests.
* The motivation for new code should be explained in a bug or enhancement request (a github issue with a label that indicates bug or enhancement). Writing a bug or enhancement issue does not commit you to implementing the related code, but we welcome your contributions to address the issues.
* If bug or enhancement request is sufficiently complex, the work should be broken into multiple tasks (github issues with a task label) that explain the scope of work.
* If you are planning to add code, please assign the corresponding issues to yourself.
* Pull requests should refer the issues (bugs, enhancement, tasks) that explain the motivation and scope of work.
