### OHMS merge team
The merge team is made up of a few OHMS key developers who have permissions to merge pull requests. Base on availability and expertise, the members of the merge team will decide who will review and approve each pull request.
### Code Reviews
OHMS code is reviewed using github: reviewers comment on pull-requests.  Reviewers must be crystal clear in review comments if they believe an issue must be addressed before code is merged. The merge team member(s) assigned to the review will consider “must address” review comments and work with submitter and reviewer to resolve the issue.  Resolutions may include updates to the pull request, or the reviewer creating a bug report (issue) requesting the issue be addressed in a separate Pull Request.
